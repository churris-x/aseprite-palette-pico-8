![Cover image of palette](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3fde247-4615-443d-a6a7-c3ef4392307c)

My own copy of the PICO-8 palette for the Aseprite pixel editor.

## Install & Usage

1. Go to latest release and download the `.aseprite-extension` file
2. Opening it should launch Aseprite, which will then ask if you want to install the extension
3. On an open project, click the middle button called `Presets` above the palette area
4. Search or scroll untill you find the pico-8 palettes
5. Have fun!

## Todo
- [ ] Figure out how to sign the release with a private key?
- [ ] Remove default pico 8 since it's shipped with Aseprite?
